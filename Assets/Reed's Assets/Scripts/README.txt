**UPDATED

- email tym

Things to Change:

- EnemyBehavior lines 40, 44, and 65
- HitBehavior line 10
- Sensor line 29

* Anything that is a public float can be changed based on how you envisioned 
  the enemy to be balanced

* The LayerMasks in Sensor should be changed to whatever the names of your 
  layers in your project are


** Everything else should be all set, but please let me know if there are bugs 
or anything missing and I will make sure to add it.
